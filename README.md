# Neural-network-from-Scratch-Without-Using-Tensorflow
<br>
1. Implemented a Neural Network model without using tensorflow
<br>
2. Implemented the Gradient Descent function for calculating the Weights and Bias without using Tensorflow
<br>
3. Made use of Sigmoid Function Without using Tensorflow to calculate the summation of weights and bias
<br>
4. Used the Log Loss Function to calculate the loss in the neural network model and the lesser the loss the better the perforamnce of the model.
